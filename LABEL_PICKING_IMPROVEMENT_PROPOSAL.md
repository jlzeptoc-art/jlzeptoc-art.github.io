# Digital Label Picking System - Management Proposal

## Executive Summary

**Proposal:** Replace paper-based label picking process with an iPad-based digital system to improve accuracy, reduce waste, and streamline operations.

**Investment Required:** 1 iPad (existing or new) + minimal setup time  
**Expected ROI:** 15-30 minutes saved per shift + reduced errors + better tracking

---

## Current Process Challenges

### Current Workflow Issues:
1. **Paper Waste:** Daily printing of full schedules for both shifts
2. **Manual Calculations:** Associates must calculate bottle labels (case qty × pack type) manually
3. **Tracking Errors:** Physical scratching off labels can be missed or unclear
4. **Lost Schedules:** Paper schedules can be misplaced, especially for rollover items
5. **No Progress Visibility:** No real-time view of picking progress
6. **Search Limitations:** Hard to find label locations for items not on current schedule

### Time & Cost Impact:
- **Printing Time:** ~5 minutes per shift × 2 shifts = 10 min/day
- **Calculation Errors:** 2-3 mistakes per day requiring rework (~10-15 min)
- **Lost Schedule Recovery:** ~5-10 min when schedule is misplaced
- **Total Daily Waste:** ~25-35 minutes + error correction time

## Proposed Solution: Digital Label Picking System

### Key Features:

#### 1. **Automatic Calculations**
- System automatically calculates bottle label quantities
- Shows: "192 bottle labels needed (48 cases × 4 bottles/case)"
- Eliminates manual math errors

#### 2. **Visual Progress Tracking**
- Real-time progress dashboard showing:
  - Total items to pick
  - Bottle labels picked (with percentage)
  - Box labels picked (with percentage)
  - Haz labels needed
- Associates can see completion status at a glance

#### 3. **Touch-Based Picking**
- Simple tap to mark labels as picked (turns green)
- No more scratching off paper
- Clear visual feedback
- Works on iPad with touch-optimized interface

#### 4. **Search Functionality**
- "Search Source" feature finds label locations for:
  - Rollover items from previous days
  - Items not on current schedule
  - Quick lookup when schedule is lost

#### 5. **Shift Management**
- Automatically detects first vs. second shift
- Separate tracking for each shift
- Easy switching between shifts

#### 6. **User-Friendly Interface**
- Clear instructions at top of screen
- Help icons for guidance
- Color-coded indicators (green = picked, yellow = haz)
- Large touch targets for easy iPad use

## Benefits & ROI

### Time Savings:
- **Eliminate Printing:** 10 min/day saved
- **Faster Calculations:** 5-8 min/day saved (automatic vs. manual)
- **Reduced Errors:** 10-15 min/day saved (no rework)
- **Faster Lookups:** 5 min/day saved (search vs. manual finding)
- **Total Daily Savings:** ~30-38 minutes

### Cost Savings (Annual):
- **Paper & Ink:** ~$200-300/year
- **Time Savings:** 30 min/day × 250 workdays = 125 hours/year
- **Error Reduction:** Fewer production delays, better quality

### Operational Benefits:
- ✅ **Better Accuracy:** Automatic calculations eliminate math errors
- ✅ **Real-Time Tracking:** Managers can see progress without walking to label area
- ✅ **Reduced Waste:** No paper schedules to print or lose
- ✅ **Better Training:** New associates can use system with minimal training
- ✅ **Audit Trail:** Digital record of what was picked (stored locally)
- ✅ **Scalability:** Easy to add features (barcode scanning, reporting, etc.)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Pilot (Week 1)
- Install app on 1 iPad
- Train 1-2 associates
- Run parallel with paper process
- Gather feedback

### Phase 2: Rollout (Week 2-3)
- Train remaining associates
- Full deployment
- Remove paper process
- Monitor and adjust

### Phase 3: Optimization (Ongoing)
- Add features based on feedback
- Generate reports for management
- Integrate with other systems if needed

## Technical Details

### Requirements:
- **Hardware:** 1 iPad (any model with modern browser)
- **Software:** Web-based app (no installation needed)
- **Network:** WiFi connection (or can work offline)
- **Data Source:** Existing Excel schedule file

### Setup Time:
- **Initial Setup:** 15 minutes (load app, bookmark)
- **Training:** 10-15 minutes per associate
- **Total:** ~1 hour for full deployment

### Maintenance:
- **Minimal:** App updates automatically
- **Data:** Uses existing Excel file (no new data entry)
- **Support:** Simple web-based interface, easy troubleshooting

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Concerns & Solutions:

**Concern:** "What if iPad breaks or battery dies?"  
**Solution:** Keep one paper backup schedule, or use phone as backup

**Concern:** "Associates won't adapt to technology"  
**Solution:** Simple touch interface, minimal training needed, clear instructions on screen

**Concern:** "Network issues in label area"  
**Solution:** App works offline, data syncs when online

**Concern:** "Cost of iPad"  
**Solution:** Can use existing iPad, or low-cost iPad (~$300) pays for itself in 2-3 months

---

## Success Metrics

### Track These KPIs:
1. **Time to Complete Picking:** Should decrease by 20-30%
2. **Error Rate:** Should decrease by 80%+ (eliminate calculation errors)
3. **Schedule Loss Incidents:** Should decrease to near zero
4. **Associate Satisfaction:** Survey after 2 weeks
5. **Paper Usage:** Track reduction in printing

---

## Next Steps

### To Get Started:
1. **Approve Proposal:** Review and approve this proposal
2. **Identify iPad:** Use existing or purchase one
3. **Schedule Demo:** See the system in action
4. **Pilot Test:** Run 1-week pilot with 1-2 associates
5. **Full Rollout:** Deploy to all associates after successful pilot
