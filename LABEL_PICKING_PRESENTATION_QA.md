## Label Picking System — Practice Q&A (for proposal meeting)

### 1) “What problem are we solving?”
- **Answer**: We’re removing wasted time and avoidable errors from label picking—printing schedules, manual bottle-label math, and unclear “picked” tracking. The digital view adds auto-calcs, tap-to-confirm, and quick search for rollover items.

### 2) “How much time do we actually save?”
- **Answer**: Conservatively **~25–35 minutes/day** across both shifts by eliminating printing, reducing math/rework, and speeding up rollovers. The pilot will confirm the baseline and actual savings with simple timing + rework counts.

### 3) “What’s the cost?”
- **Answer**: Minimum cost is **one iPad** (or we use an existing device) plus ~1 hour total setup/training time. The web app runs in the browser—no paid software or licenses.

### 4) “What if Wi‑Fi is down?”
- **Answer**: We can keep a **local Excel file** as the source and keep **one printed backup** for the shift. If we move to Google Sheets later, the link is still a single config value to update.

### 5) “What if the iPad dies / breaks?”
- **Answer**: We keep a simple fallback: printed schedule for that shift, or open the same link on another device (phone/PC). The process doesn’t stop.

### 6) “Will this slow associates down or confuse them?”
- **Answer**: The flow stays the same—pick labels in the same locations—but the system removes manual math and makes “picked” status obvious. Training is **10–15 minutes** with a one-page quick guide.

### 7) “How do we prevent people from marking things picked without actually picking them?”
- **Answer**: Same risk exists with paper scratch-offs. Mitigation: quick supervisor spot-checks early, and we can add simple controls later (e.g., confirmation prompts for haz, or a ‘review’ step).

### 8) “Does this store data? Is it secure?”
- **Answer**: It’s a simple internal workflow tool. “Picked” status is stored **locally in the browser on the device** (not uploaded). The schedule file comes from our Excel/Sheet source. No customer data involved.

### 9) “How do we handle rollovers?”
- **Answer**: Two ways: select the correct day from the dropdown, and use **Search Source** to look up label locations by item #/description. This is faster than hunting paper schedules.

### 10) “What if the bottle label calculation is wrong?”
- **Answer**: The system calculates from the description pattern, and we validate in the pilot. If a product format doesn’t match a pattern, we’ll improve the recognition rules or reference the pack type from Source. Worst case: it shows no calculation and the associate confirms using Source (same as today).

### 11) “How do we measure success in a week?”
- **Answer**: Track three metrics: **pick completion time**, **rework/errors**, and **printing/handling time**. If we see a meaningful reduction (target 20–30% improvement) and associates prefer it, we roll out.

### 12) “What do you need from leadership today?”
- **Answer**: Approval for a **3–5 day pilot**, access to an iPad (or permission to use an existing device), and agreement on the success metrics + a short follow-up review.

### Your close (30 seconds)
- **Close**: “This is a low-cost, low-risk improvement that removes daily waste and reduces label picking errors. Let’s pilot it this week, measure impact, and decide on rollout based on data.”
