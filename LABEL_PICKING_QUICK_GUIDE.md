## Label Picking — Quick Guide (Associates)

### Getting started (30 seconds)
- **Open the app** on the iPad (bookmark on home screen).
- **Confirm the schedule** at the top (today auto-selects; use the dropdown if needed).
- **Use the Progress Summary** to see how many items are left.

### What each column means
- **Ordered QTY**: the scheduled quantity (usually in cases).
  - If it’s a case line, you’ll also see **bottle label quantity** calculated underneath.
- **Haz Info**: only relevant when it indicates **corrosive**.
- **Bottle Label Location / Box Label Location**: where to pick the labels.

### How to pick (the workflow)
- **Bottle labels**
  - Read the **bottle label quantity** shown under Ordered QTY.
  - Pick that amount at the **Bottle Label Location**.
  - **Tap the location** to mark it picked (turns green). Tap again to undo.
- **Box labels**
  - Pick at the **Box Label Location**.
  - **Tap the location** to mark it picked.
- **Haz labels (only when needed)**
  - Pick haz labels **only if Haz Info indicates corrosive** (example: **“Corrosive”** or **“COR‑XL”**).
  - **Tap Haz Info** to mark haz picked.

### Rollover items / can’t find a label location
- Use **Search Source** at the bottom:
  - Type **item #** or **description**
  - Press **Enter** or tap **Search**
  - Use the **Label Location / Box Label Location** shown in results

### If something looks wrong
- **No bottle calculation shown**: the pack type may not be recognizable from the description—use **Search Source** to confirm pack type.
- **Schedule won’t load**: refresh the page; verify Wi‑Fi; if still down, use paper backup for that shift.

### Reset options
- **Tap again** to un-pick a single entry.
- **Clear All Picked** clears picks for the selected day only.
