## Step-by-Step Picking Process

### Step 1: Review the Schedule
- Look at the **Progress Summary** at the top to see:
  - How many items you need to pick
  - How many you've already picked
  - How many haz labels are needed

### Step 2: Pick Bottle Labels
1. Find the product in the schedule
2. Look at the **Ordered QTY** column - you'll see:
   - Case quantity (e.g., "48 CS")
   - **Bottle label calculation** shown below (e.g., "192 bottle labels needed (48 cases × 4 bottles/case)")
3. Go to the **Bottle Label Location** shown in the table
4. **Tap the location** to mark it as picked (it will turn green)
5. Pick the calculated quantity of bottle labels

### Step 3: Pick Box Labels
1. Find the **Box Label Location** for the same product
2. **Tap the location** to mark it as picked (it will turn green)
3. Pick the box labels (usually 1 per case)

### Step 4: Pick Haz Labels (if needed)
1. Look for the **⚠ HAZ** badge next to Haz Info
2. If you see this badge, you need to pick a corrosive label
3. The haz info tells you which label to pick

### Step 5: Track Your Progress
- Watch the **Progress Summary** update as you tap labels
- Green = Picked ✓
- White = Not picked yet

## Tips & Tricks

### Finding Labels for Rollover Items
- Use the **"Search Source"** section at the bottom
- Type the item number or description
- Click "Search" to find the label location
- This works for items from previous days or items not on the schedule

### Common Pack Types
- **4/1 CS** = 4 bottles per case
- **12/1 CS** = 12 bottles per case
- **6/1 CS** = 6 bottles per case
- **2/1 CS** = 2 bottles per case
- **1/1 CS** = 1 bottle per case

The system calculates this automatically - you don't need to do the math!

### If You Make a Mistake
- **Tap again** to un-pick a label (turns back to white)
- Or use **"Clear All Picked"** button to reset everything for the day

### Switching Between Shifts
- Use the dropdown at the top to switch between:
  - First Shift schedule
  - Second Shift schedule
- Each shift tracks picks separately
